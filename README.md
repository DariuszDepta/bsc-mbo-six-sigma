# BSC => MBO => Six Sigma

## Introduction

This article is based on core concepts I originally developed with the intention of exploring them
in a doctoral dissertation, which, while never formally undertaken, laid the groundwork for the insights shared here.

The planned research was intended to focus on integrating the Balanced Scorecard (BSC),
Management by Objectives (MBO), and Six Sigma methodologies into a cohesive approach,
aiming to enable companies to achieve high efficiency and strategic alignment.

By combining these three powerful tools, my planned doctoral work aimed to demonstrate how organizations
could simultaneously improve quality, align goals, foster accountability, and benefit from
an ever-growing and learning workforce.

Today, however, instead of writing and reading doctoral dissertations, one can simply ask ChatGPT.

A sample Q&A session is presented below, focusing on a small software development company
operating in a fast-changing business environment.  

## What is BSC?

The Balanced Scorecard (BSC) is a strategic management tool that helps organizations translate their vision and strategy
into a set of performance measures across four key perspectives. Developed in the early 1990s by Robert Kaplan and David Norton,
the BSC aims to provide a more comprehensive view of organizational performance beyond traditional financial metrics.

### The four perspectives of the Balanced Scorecard are:

- **Financial Perspective**
 
  This includes traditional financial measures, such as revenue growth, profit margins, and return on investment.
  It answers the question: _**How do we look to our shareholders?**_

- **Customer Perspective**
 
  This focuses on customer satisfaction, retention, and acquisition. Typical metrics include customer satisfaction scores,
  market share, and customer loyalty. It addresses the question: _**How do our customers view us?**_

- **Internal Process Perspective**
 
  This involves improving internal processes to drive value for customers and achieve financial goals.
  Metrics here might focus on process efficiency, quality, and innovation.
  This perspective asks: _**What must we excel at internally to satisfy customers and financial goals?**_

- **Learning and Growth Perspective**
 
  This looks at the organization’s ability to innovate and improve over time, emphasizing employee skills,
  training, and corporate culture. It addresses the question: _**How can we continue to improve and create value?**_

> The Balanced Scorecard enables organizations to take a balanced approach to performance measurement,
> combining both leading (predictive) and lagging (historical) indicators. This provides a holistic
> view of the organization’s health, aligns day-to-day work with strategic objectives,
> and facilitates better decision-making across all levels of the organization.

## Is it possible to use balanced scorecard in a very small company with fast-changing business environment?

Yes, using a balanced scorecard (BSC) in a small company with a fast-changing business environment is possible
and can be highly beneficial, though it may need to be adapted to suit the company's size and the dynamic nature
of its environment.

### Here’s how and why it can work:

- **Strategic Clarity and Focus**

  In a small company, leaders often need to juggle multiple roles, which can make it challenging to focus on strategy.
  A balanced scorecard helps maintain a clear, consistent focus on strategic objectives across four key areas:
  **financial**, **customer**, **internal processes**, and **learning/growth**.
  This structure can prevent short-term decisions from overshadowing long-term goals.
   

- **Flexibility and Simplification**
  
  Traditional BSC frameworks can be complex, but small companies can simplify the scorecard.
  You might focus on fewer metrics within each of the four perspectives.
  For example, if customer acquisition is a top priority, the customer perspective could center on metrics
  like new customer growth and satisfaction, allowing for focused improvement without overwhelming resources.


- **Adaptability in a Fast-Changing Environment**
 
  In a dynamic business environment, goals and metrics may need frequent review and updates.
  A BSC can be made more flexible by setting shorter review cycles (e.g., monthly or quarterly) 
  and adjusting metrics as priorities change. This agile approach keeps the scorecard relevant
  and aligned with the latest business needs.


- **Improved Decision-Making**
 
  A BSC gives leaders structured data points, making it easier to see the impact of changes in the environment
  and adjust accordingly. This can be especially valuable in a fast-changing industry, where staying adaptable is crucial.

 
- **Encouraging a Balanced Perspective**
  
  Small businesses sometimes focus heavily on immediate revenue or customer demands, especially in turbulent markets.
  A BSC ensures balanced attention to all areas essential for sustainable growth, like employee development
  or internal process efficiency, which helps build resilience.

> By customizing the BSC for simplicity and agility, even a small business in a fast-paced market can leverage its benefits.
> This keeps the focus on what's most important and enables quick adjustments as conditions change.

## What is MBO?

Management by Objectives (MBO) is a performance management approach in which **managers and employees** work together
to set, track, and achieve specific objectives **aligned with organizational goals**.
Developed by Peter Drucker in the 1950s, MBO focuses on aligning individual goals with the company’s broader objectives,
fostering clear communication, and motivating employees by involving them in the goal-setting process.

### The main steps in the MBO process include:

- **Setting Objectives**
 
  Managers and employees collaboratively define clear, measurable, and time-bound objectives that support organizational goals.
  This process ensures that each employee’s goals contribute directly to the company's strategic priorities.

 
- **Developing Action Plans**
 
  Each objective is broken down into actionable steps or tasks that outline how the goals will be achieved.
  This helps employees know exactly what needs to be done and provides a roadmap for success.


- **Monitoring and Evaluation**
 
  Managers periodically review progress toward objectives with employees.
  Regular check-ins allow for adjustments if needed and provide opportunities for feedback and support.


- **Performance Evaluation and Reward**
 
  At the end of the performance period, managers evaluate how well the objectives were met and reward employees
  based on their achievement. Rewards may include bonuses, promotions, or other incentives, aligning recognition with results.

### Benefits of MBO:

- **Clear Direction and Alignment**
 
  Ensures employees know what is expected of them and how their work supports larger goals.


- **Employee Motivation and Engagement**
 
  Involving employees in goal-setting can increase their commitment and motivation to achieve those goals.

 
- **Performance Transparency**:
 
  MBO makes it easier to assess performance because success is defined by specific, measurable objectives.

### Challenges of MBO:

- **Time-Consuming**
 
  Setting and reviewing individual objectives can require significant time and effort.
 
- **Overemphasis on Goals**
 
  An intense focus on achieving specific objectives can sometimes lead employees to overlook important
  aspects of their roles or adopt a short-term mindset.
 
- **Difficulty Adapting**
 
  In a rapidly changing environment, objectives may need frequent adjustments, which can be challenging
  within a structured MBO framework.
 
> Overall, MBO provides a systematic approach to goal-setting and performance management that emphasizes accountability,
> alignment, and communication between employees and management.

## Can MBO be applied in a very small company with fast-changing business environment?

Yes, MBO can be applied in a very small company with a fast-changing business environment, but it may require
some adaptations to make it practical and effective.

### Here are some considerations for implementing MBO in such a context:

- **Set Shorter Goal Cycles**
 
  In a fast-changing environment, traditional MBO cycles (often annually) may not be flexible enough.
  Instead, goals could be set for shorter periods, such as quarterly or even monthly, to allow for faster adaptation
  to new business realities and market changes.

- **Prioritize Agility in Goal-Setting**
 
  Rather than setting rigid objectives, focus on goals that are broad enough to allow flexibility in how they’re achieved.
  For example, instead of a highly specific goal, a small company might focus on objectives
  like "increase customer engagement" with flexibility in tactics as conditions change.

- **Involve Employees in Dynamic Goal Adjustments**
 
  In a small company, open and frequent communication is easier to achieve.
  Regular check-ins allow for ongoing alignment and adjustment of goals based on market shifts
  or new business priorities, keeping employees engaged and adaptive.

- **Focus on Critical High-Impact Objectives**
 
  Since resources in small businesses are often limited, it’s crucial to focus on objectives that will have
  the most immediate impact. This selective focus helps ensure that energy and resources are directed toward
  activities that align with the company's strategic needs.

- **Simplify the Process**
 
  Avoid lengthy documentation or formalities. Small companies with fast-changing environments benefit
  from a lean approach to MBO, where goals are discussed, recorded, and adjusted in a straightforward way.
  This helps save time and keeps everyone focused on execution.

- **Emphasize Learning and Growth**
 
  As the business landscape evolves, an emphasis on learning and continuous improvement can keep the company agile.
  Encourage employees to set learning objectives alongside performance goals to build new skills that will help the
  company respond to changes.

- **Maintain Motivation with Immediate Feedback and Rewards**
 
  Small businesses can use the MBO approach to motivate employees by providing timely feedback
  and recognition for progress. Because the environment is fast-paced, rewards and acknowledgments need
  to be timely and aligned with short-term wins.

> In short, MBO can work well in a small, dynamic company by keeping the process agile and focused on high-impact,
> short-term goals. This approach can help small teams stay aligned and responsive to changes
> without the burden of excessive structure.

## What is Six Sigma?

Six Sigma is a data-driven methodology aimed at improving business processes by identifying and eliminating
defects or inefficiencies, reducing variability, and improving quality. Originally developed by Motorola in the 1980s,
Six Sigma became popular after General Electric (GE) adopted it under the leadership of Jack Welch in the 1990s.

> The primary goal of Six Sigma is to achieve near-perfection in processes, ideally reaching a level
> where only 3.4 defects per million opportunities occur. This level of quality ensures high consistency,
> customer satisfaction, and cost savings by reducing errors and waste.

### Key Concepts of Six Sigma

#### DMAIC Framework

Six Sigma projects typically follow the DMAIC process:

- **Define**: Identify the problem or improvement area, define the project goals, and specify the customer’s needs.
- **Measure**: Collect data and establish baseline metrics to quantify the problem.
- **Analyze**: Identify root causes of the problem by analyzing the data.
- **Improve**: Develop and implement solutions to eliminate root causes.
- **Control**: Implement controls to sustain improvements over time.

#### Six Sigma Belt System

Six Sigma practitioners follow a structured certification hierarchy, often described as "belts" (similar to martial arts):

- **Yellow Belt**: Basic understanding of Six Sigma principles.
- **Green Belt**: Knowledge to lead small projects and assist with data collection and analysis.
- **Black Belt**: Expertise in Six Sigma tools, leading larger projects.
- **Master Black Belt**: Leadership role, coaching Black Belts and strategizing Six Sigma implementation across an organization.
- **Champion**: Executive sponsor who ensures Six Sigma aligns with organizational goals.

#### Data-Driven Decision-Making

Six Sigma relies heavily on statistical tools and data analysis to make decisions, identify variations,
and confirm process improvements. Commonly used tools include Pareto charts, Fishbone diagrams, control charts,
and process mapping.

#### Reducing Variation

Six Sigma aims to reduce process variability to ensure that outputs consistently meet customer expectations.
By controlling variation, organizations can reduce defects, waste, and inefficiencies.

### Benefits of Six Sigma

- **Improved Quality**: By minimizing defects and variability, products or services consistently meet customer expectations.
- **Cost Savings**: Process improvements often lead to reduced waste, rework, and resource consumption, which lowers costs.
- **Enhanced Customer Satisfaction**: Reliable, high-quality outputs improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- **Increased Efficiency**: Streamlined processes lead to faster, more efficient workflows.
- **Employee Involvement**: Six Sigma encourages employees at all levels to participate in improvement initiatives,
  which can lead to higher engagement and a culture of continuous improvement.

### When to Use Six Sigma

Six Sigma is particularly useful for organizations that need high-quality standards or operate in highly
regulated industries (e.g., manufacturing, healthcare, finance). However, its principles can be adapted for various
industries and organizations, even smaller businesses, by simplifying the approach and focusing on high-impact areas.

> In summary, Six Sigma is a structured, data-driven approach to improving quality and efficiency in business
> processes by reducing variability and defects, which can lead to substantial cost savings
> and greater customer satisfaction.

## Does it make sense to use Six Sigma in a very small software development company with fast changing business environment?

Using Six Sigma in a very small software development company with a fast-changing business environment
can offer benefits but may require substantial adaptation to be practical and effective.

### Here are some considerations to determine whether it makes sense and how to make Six Sigma work in this context:

#### Potential Benefits

- **Improving Quality and Reducing Bugs**: Six Sigma’s focus on reducing defects could be useful for a software company
  that wants to improve code quality, reduce bugs, and enhance customer satisfaction.
  For example, Six Sigma can help establish more consistent coding practices, testing standards, and review processes.

- **Increasing Efficiency**: Six Sigma can identify inefficiencies in processes such as deployment, testing,
  or issue resolution, helping streamline workflows. This might be valuable if the company is facing recurring
  bottlenecks that slow down releases.

- **Customer-Centric Focus**: Six Sigma emphasizes meeting customer expectations, which is beneficial in a fast-changing
  environment where customer needs and priorities might shift frequently.

- **Data-Driven Decision-Making**: If the company wants to make decisions based on data rather than intuition,
  Six Sigma can help by encouraging the collection and analysis of metrics, which might lead to better resource
  allocation and process improvements.

#### Challenges and Adaptations

- **Need for Agility and Flexibility**: Six Sigma projects can sometimes be time-consuming and rigid,
  while a small software company often needs quick, iterative changes.
  A full-scale Six Sigma implementation might be too cumbersome, so it would be better to adopt just specific
  principles or tools (like root cause analysis or process mapping) rather than the full DMAIC approach.

- **Small Sample Sizes and Limited Data**: Six Sigma relies on statistical analysis, which requires large data sets
  to yield significant insights. A small software company might not have the data volume needed
  for traditional Six Sigma methods. In this case, simpler data analysis methods and quick metrics
  may be more practical.

- **Adapting to Fast-Changing Requirements**: Six Sigma aims to create stable, repeatable processes,
  which may clash with the fluid nature of a fast-evolving software company.
  Instead of focusing on extensive process control, the company could focus on critical quality aspects,
  like improving testing or deployment processes that directly impact customer satisfaction.

- **Resource Constraints**: Six Sigma training and certification can be resource-intensive.
  For a small team, it may be more practical to train key team members in selective Six Sigma tools
  and principles rather than investing in full certifications.

#### Practical Approach for Small Software Companies

- **Selective Use of Six Sigma Tools**: Instead of implementing the entire Six Sigma methodology,
  focus on specific tools that address immediate needs, like Pareto analysis for identifying recurring bugs
  or root cause analysis for frequent deployment issues.

- **Combine with Agile**: Six Sigma can be blended with Agile principles. Agile emphasizes rapid iterations
  and flexibility, while Six Sigma offers tools for quality improvement.
  The two can complement each other if used thoughtfully — for example, integrating quality checks
  and metrics tracking into Agile sprints.

- **Focus on High-Impact Areas**: Limit Six Sigma’s application to areas that significantly impact quality
  and customer satisfaction. This targeted approach allows you to get the most benefit without overwhelming
  the team with process complexity.

#### Conclusion

For a very small software company with a rapidly changing environment, a full Six Sigma program might be excessive.
However, selectively using Six Sigma tools and principles, especially in areas where process inefficiencies
or quality issues impact customer satisfaction, can provide value. By keeping it lean and integrating
it with Agile practices, the company can benefit from Six Sigma without compromising its need for speed and adaptability.

## How to combine BSC, MBO and Six Sigma and adapt it for a very small software company with fast changing business environment?

Combining Balanced Scorecard (BSC), Management by Objectives (MBO), and Six Sigma in a very small,
fast-changing software company can be achieved by creating a streamlined, flexible approach that leverages
the strengths of each method without overwhelming the team.

### Here’s how you could adapt each framework to create a hybrid system tailored to the company's needs:

#### 1. Start with a Simplified Balanced Scorecard (BSC) for Strategic Alignment
   
The Balanced Scorecard helps to set a balanced focus on key areas, but in a small software company
with limited resources, this should be kept simple:

- **Define Key Perspectives**: Use a simplified version of the traditional four BSC perspectives, focusing on:
  - **Financial Goals**: Profitability, cost control, or revenue growth.
  - **Customer Satisfaction**: Metrics like user satisfaction, retention, and product quality.
  - **Internal Processes**: Focus on critical workflows, like software development and deployment efficiency.
  - **Learning and Growth**: Emphasize skills development, technology training, and team capacity.
   
 
- **Identify a Few Core Metrics**: Select one or two key metrics for each perspective,
  focusing on areas with the greatest impact on business goals, for example:
  - **Financial**: Monthly recurring revenue (MRR).
  - **Customer**: Bug reports per release, customer satisfaction ratings.
  - **Internal Processes**: Average time for bug resolution, deployment frequency.
  - **Learning and Growth**: Training hours, skill competency matrix for critical technologies. 
 
- **Set Short Review Cycles**: In a fast-changing environment, set short review cycles (monthly or quarterly)
  to evaluate these metrics and adjust goals quickly.

#### 2. Integrate MBO for Individual and Team Goals Aligned with BSC

MBO will help cascade these strategic goals into practical objectives that can guide day-to-day activities:

- **Set Agile, Short-Term Objectives**

  Instead of annual objectives, set quarterly or monthly objectives for each team member, aligned with the BSC metrics,
  for example:
  - A developer might have an objective to reduce bug density by 10% in the next sprint.
  - The team could set a collective objective to improve deployment speed by 20% within the next quarter.


- **Collaborative Goal-Setting**
 
  Involve employees in the goal-setting process to ensure alignment with their work and encourage engagement.
  Employees can propose objectives based on what they feel will improve process efficiency or customer satisfaction,
  which can then be tied back to BSC metrics.


- **Frequent Check-Ins**
 
  Regular, informal check-ins (e.g., weekly) keep the objectives top of mind and allow for adjustments
  based on shifting priorities. This flexibility is essential in a fast-changing software environment.

#### 3. Use Six Sigma Tools for Targeted Quality Improvement
   
Incorporate Six Sigma tools selectively to improve quality and efficiency,
focusing on areas where defects or inefficiencies directly impact customer satisfaction or development speed.

- **Identify High-Impact Problem Areas**
 
  Use BSC and MBO results to pinpoint areas with quality issues or inefficiencies, such as frequent customer-reported bugs or long deployment times.


- **Apply Key Six Sigma Tools as Needed**
  - **Root Cause Analysis** Conduct a root cause analysis (e.g., using a Fishbone diagram) to understand recurring defects or deployment delays.
  - **Pareto Analysis**: Identify the "vital few" causes of the most common bugs or bottlenecks.
  - **Process Mapping**: Map key processes, such as code reviews or testing phases, to find inefficiencies.
  - **Track Improvements in BSC Metrics**: Implement improvements in small, iterative cycles (similar to Agile sprints),
    then evaluate their impact on the relevant BSC metrics (e.g., customer satisfaction or internal process efficiency).

### Hybrid Implementation Process

Here’s a step-by-step approach for this hybrid framework:

- **Define Quarterly Strategic Goals with BSC**
 
  Use the Balanced Scorecard to set quarterly strategic goals that capture the most important
  company-wide priorities across four perspectives.

- **Cascade into Individual Objectives Using MBO**
 
  Break down these BSC goals into short-term, achievable objectives (using MBO) for individuals or small teams.
  Set specific, measurable targets that can be adjusted as needs shift.

- **Use Six Sigma Tools for Process Improvements**
 
  Where there are clear performance gaps or recurring issues, apply Six Sigma tools to analyze
  and address the root causes. Implement changes in quick, controlled cycles.

- **Review and Adjust Regularly**
 
  At the end of each cycle (monthly or quarterly), review progress on BSC metrics, assess the impact
  of any Six Sigma improvements, and adjust objectives as needed.
  This ensures responsiveness to any market or customer changes.

### Example Scenario

**Improving product quality and deployment speed**

- **BSC goal**:
 
  - Improve product quality and deployment speed to enhance customer satisfaction.
 
 
- **MBO objectives**:
  - **Developer Objective**: "Reduce bug density by 15% by the end of the quarter."
  - **Team Objective**: "Increase deployment frequency by 20% within three months."

 
- **Six Sigma tool application**:
  - Conduct a root cause analysis on the most frequent types of bugs.
  - Use process mapping to streamline the testing and deployment pipeline.

 
- **Review and adjust**:
  - Track the impact of these actions on customer satisfaction and internal process metrics.
  - Adjust objectives and processes if the environment or customer requirements change.

### Summary

> This combined approach leverages the strengths of BSC for strategic alignment, MBO for goal-setting and accountability,
> and Six Sigma for targeted quality improvements. By keeping the process lightweight and adaptable,
> this hybrid system helps the company stay focused on quality and efficiency without losing flexibility.
> This can ultimately drive both short-term responsiveness and long-term improvement in a rapidly changing environment.
